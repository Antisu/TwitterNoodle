# // TODO:threshold handling?

class PipeBase():

    """ This class is meant to be a base class for 
        certain 'pipes' which are used to construct
        the 'pipelines' for this project.

        It includes input and output lists, which are 
        explicetly not encapsulated such that probing
        is easier (cost accepted).

        Thresholds(see init) are meant to indicate the
        maximum size of input and output lists. If these
        limits are exceeded, then one of two scenarios 
        will occur:
            1 - New data is dropped.
            2 - New data is added, but oldes is dropped.
        One of these two secarios will be determined by
        self.refresh_data (2 if True).

        Processing this pipe must be called manually with
        the method self.'process'.
